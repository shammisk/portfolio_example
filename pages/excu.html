      <h3>Assistant Director : Leo Club of 306 C2 University of Sri Jayewardenepura</h3></br>
      (2022 July - 2023 July)
      <p>During my time in this position, I gained invaluable life experiences and acquired a diverse skill set. I had the opportunity to delve into various areas, including social media handling, graphic design, video editing, leadership enhancement, and team management. Additionally, I had the privilege of serving as a project secretary for two projects, which further enriched my experience.

      </br>
      </br>
        One notable project I was involved in is called "මාතෘ අරුණැල්ල" (Maathi Arunalla). This project focused on providing assistance to underprivileged pregnant women in the Horana area. Our efforts included donating essential items, organizing an almsgiving ceremony, and delivering educational lectures. Oshadi Dilthara served as the project chairperson, and the project took place from December 2022 to February 2023. For more information and visual documentation, please refer to the following Facebook album:

  </br></br>
        
        Another commendable project I participated in was the "Save Her Project," which aimed to combat harassment. Through this initiative, we actively published article series, produced video content, and provided donations to support individuals in vulnerable situations. Sonali Abeyasighe assumed the role of project chairperson, and the project spanned from January 2023 to March 2023.
      </br></br>
        
        Throughout my involvement, I not only gained expertise in various domains such as graphic design, video editing, creative writing, project planning, team collaboration, leadership development, monitoring, event coordination, and communication skills but also cultivated a professional demeanor.
      </br></br>
        
        I am grateful for the valuable experiences I gained during my tenure in this position, and I remain dedicated to utilizing my skills to make a positive impact on society. Should you require any further information or assistance, please feel free to let me know.</p>
